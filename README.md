## COVID-19 growth

COVID-19 generally follows a similar growth pattern. The below is updated on March 11, 2020 and shows the number of cases in the days since >200 cases were reported in that country. The USA looks to be 7-10 days behind Italy.

If you look at cases per capita, the USA is growing just as quickly but is not nearly as saturated (so far).

New York state seems to be growing much faster than the formerly worrying Washington state.
